* Communication Technology and Consequences
** Communication Methods
*** Serial Transmission

During serial data transmission, bits are set one after the other down a single (serial) data channel. A second data wire will be needed for simultaneous bi-directional data transfer. Sometimes an additional /ground/ wire is used to reduce the adverse affects of interference. Additional control wires may also be used in serial data connections.

*** Parallel Transmission

Multiple bits of data are sent simultaneously along a number of parallel data wires.

*** Comparison of Methods

Each of the wires used to transmit individual bits in a parallel connection will differ slightly from the others. This subtle difference will affect the rate at which data can travel along the wire and hence the time taken for a bit to travel a certain distance. This causes bits to arrive at the receiver at different times, a phenomena know as /skew/.

Parallel transmission becomes impractical over larger distances, as /skew/ becomes more pronounced. Parallel transmission is, however, suitable in some environments, for example onboard motherboards and /Integrated Circuits/, where distances are small and the increased speed is valuable.

Serial connections have much smaller interfaces, making them suitable for mass manufacturing, especially in mobile devices and consumer electronics.

/Crosstalk/ between the data channels of a parallel connection can cause interference and corruption. The danger of interference due to crosstalk increases with frequency. As a result, the frequency of serial connections can be safely increased beyond the practical limits of parallel connections, meaning more data can be transmitted in a given amount of time, even if less data is transferred per cycle.

*** Bit and Baud Rate

The two measures are linked with this equation:

    /bit rate = baud rate * number of bits per baud/

In typical serial connections, /1s/ and /0s/ are represented by high and low voltages in a cable, called non-return-to-zero /(NRZ)/ communication, where the signal voltage never returns to /0v/. The /baud rate/ is the number of symbol changes per second - the number of times the signal voltage is changed / the frequency. The bit rate may be the same as the /baud rate/, although - using signal modulation - more than 2 values may be encoded within a single cycle. In such a case, the /bit rate/ (the total number of bits transferred in a second) is equal to the /baud rate/ * the number of bits per /baud/.

Increasing the number of bits per /baud/ means more data can be transferred along a narrower (possibly serial) cable in a certain amount of time.

*** Baseband and Broadband

Broadband is an analogue data transfer method, meaning there are a /continuous/ range of values (voltages) and each symbol change can represent more than two values (as in binary). Broadband connections are often multi-channel and bidirectional. These connections are frequently use in /WANs/.

Baseband is a type of digital data connection, commonly used in /LANs/, where the bit rate is often the same as the baud rate, hence each symbol is either a 0 or 1. Ethernet cables are baseband connections.

*** Latency and Bandwidth

Latency is the time taken for some data to be transmitted a certain distance, ie. from sender to receiver, irrespective of how much data is sent at once. Latency is often measured in seconds /(s)/ or milliseconds /(ms)/.

Bandwidth loosely means how much data can be received at once, irrespective of the speed the signal can travel and hence the latency between sender and receiver. Bandwidth is often measured in bits per second /(bps)/ and has a direct relationship to bit rate.

In data communication and networking, bandwidth is analogous to data transfer rate.

*** Synchronous Communication

During /synchronous transmission/, both sender and receiver share a common clock cycle for coordinating signals. This communication method depends on that clock cycle to govern communication along the wire. This type of communication is best for connections that work in real time, with a constant flow of data, for example within a computer's processor.

*** Asynchronous Communication

There is another common communication method known as /asynchronous transmission/. Neither the sender, nor the receiver share the same clock cycles. Communication is governed by start and stop bits, sent before and after a communique. The stop bit is always the opposite of the start bit. Despite the absence of a common clock, the sender and receiver must use the same baud/bit rate so that the receiver can understand the message once the start bit is received.

** Network Topology

A single computer with no connection to any other devices is described as a /stand-alone/ computer system. When a computer is connected to one or more other computers, the resulting system can be described as a /computer network/. Digital /baseband/ connections are often used inside a /local area network/. Many smaller LANs spread over a large area are often joined to others by /broadband/ connections, creating a /wide area network/.

/Physical/ network topology defines how the devices are physically connected with hardware devices and equipment. /Logical/ network topology is the layout used by devices on a network to communicate using the physical network equipment provided.

*** Physical Bus Topology

The /physical bus topology/ is a simple network configuration, used in many small home networks. Each device is connected to a /backbone/ cable which runs past every device. A /terminator/ is placed at either end of the bus.

*Advantages:*

- A bus network is inexpensive to set up and easy to maintain.
- Less cable has to be laid/installed.
- Identifying problems with equipment can be easier.

*Disadvantages:*

- Data intended for one device on the network passes many other computers.
- The single backbone cable is subject to congestion as many devices need to communicate through the network.
- Collisions can occur as devices need to send data along on the bus.
- The single backbone cable is a single point of failure. If it is not functioning, it is impossible for devices on the network to communicate with one another.

*** Physical Star Topology

The /physical star/ network configuration is a more complicated type of network, where each node has its own dedicated connection to the hub or router.

*Advantages:*

- The star network is more secure, as data intended for one computer on the network does not pass by others.
- Dedicated cables for each device eliminate the risk of collisions between signals sent by different computers.
- This type of network is more flexible and expandable, as more hubs and devices can be connected to the hub.

*Disadvantages:*

- Star networks can be more difficult and expensive to implement as more cables need to be laid/installed.
- The central hub is a single point of failure. Should the hub fail, none of the devices on the network will be able to communicate with one another.

*** Logical Topology

Logical topology is the manner in which data is handled on top of a physical network. For example, a hub might use a bus protocol to push data outward onto a star network, similar to how a physical bus network behaves.

*** MAC Addresses
** Client/Server

A /server/ is a computer which services requests from a number of clients; a response is sent back to the connected client in return. A computer may be both a client and a server simultaneously. A server might be used to process or store data.

Within a LAN, server(s) may be set-up to handle tasks common among all client computers on the network. Internet facing /web-servers/ are used to host websites and content on the internet.

*Advantages:*

A client-server configuration is preferred when central management over the whole network is needed, making this model popular in schools and businesses. Servers might be set up to handle user accounts, store files and manage backups.

*Disadvantages:*

A client-server network requires expensive hardware (the servers themselves) and personnel to maintain the servers. This makes the client-server model impractical on smaller home networks.

** Peer-to-peer

There is less core infrastructure in a decentralised peer-to-peer network. The services that would be provided by servers are shared amongst the clients.

*Advantages:*

No expensive server computers are required. Expertise and maintenance are not required on a peer-to-peer network.

*Disadvantages:*

All clients must be connected and powered-on for the network to function as expected. Peer-to-peer networking may leave a user's files visible to other devices on the network.

** Wireless Networking
*** Wi-Fi

/Wi-Fi/, standing for /wireless fidelity/, is a type of wireless network standard designed to be interoperable with /IEEE 802.11/ protocol and work alongside Ethernet at the /Network Access/ layer. Devices using wi-fi can connect to a /wireless access point/ and communicate with any other device on the network.

*** NIC

In order to connect to a wireless network, a device must have a wireless network interface card /(NIC)/, a device will have a similar card for all its other interfaces, eg. Ethernet. The NIC has a hardcoded MAC address. The combination of an NIC and a computer is called a /station/.

*** SSID

A service set identifier /(SSID)/ is a human readable name for a wireless network. It may be broadcast to devices within range of a /WAP/, or kept private.

*** Security

Any device within range of a /WAP/ could connect to an unprotected wireless network. A network password is often used in wi-fi protected access /(WPA)/ networks. /WPA2/ is also a common standard. A network owner may also choose to set up a MAC whitelist for ultimate control over which devices may connect. In order to connect, the MAC address of a computer's NIC must be added to the whitelist.

*** CSMA/CA

Connected devices share the same channel to transmit data to the /WAP/. In order to prevent multiple computers trying to communicate with the /WAP/ simultaneously, Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance /(CSMA/CA)/ is used. Before data may be sent to the /WAP/, the station checks if the channel is idle. If another device is communicating over the channel, the station waits a random amount of time before checking the status of the channel again. This process continues until the channel is free and the station is able to send data to the /WAP/.

*** RTS/CTS

One of the shortcomings of the /CSMA/CA/ standard is the /hidden node/ problem. It is possible that the /WAP/ is engaged with a station that cannot be seen or heard by a station that needs to send data. This situation is common on larger networks, where the /WAP/ serves a larger area.

Once the channel appears idle to a station, a 'request to send' signal is sent to the /WAP/. If the 'clear to send' signal is not received, the station waits a random amount of time before checking the channel status and resending the 'request to send' signal. If the /WAP/ is free, a 'clear to send' signal is returned to the station and the data can be transmitted.

* The Internet


The /Internet Protocol Suite/, often referred to as the /TCP/IP/ stack, is a collection of communication protocols adopted on the public internet and other similar computer networks. The whole protocol suite governs end-to-end communication between devices including stipulations about the way data is split into packets, addressed transmitted and routed. Much like the /Open Systems Interconnection/, these conceptual network models arrange communication protocols into abstract layers.

# 1. Physical (bit, symbol) = Link
# 2. Data link (frame) = Link
# 3. Network (packet) = Internet
# 4. Transport (segment, datagram) = Transport
# 5. Session = Application
# 6. Presentation = Application
# 7. Application = Application

** Uniform Resource Locators

A URL is a specific type of /Uniform Resource Identifier/ or URI, designed to identify web resources on computer networks. A typical URL may resemble:

#+begin_src
https://www.example.com:443/path?query
#+end_src

In the example above the *https* protocol is used, followed by the characters =://=. This whole component of the URL is called the /scheme/. The next component is the host name or IP address, separated from the port number by a colon. The remaining components are the path to the resource or file in question and the query string, separated by a question mark.

** Domain Names & DNS

A domain is an identification string which defines or identifies a /"realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control"/ within the internet (Wikipedia). Domain names conform to the rules and regulations of the /Domain Name System/, which maps a domain to other types of information, such as an IP address. Any such string registered in the *DNS* is considered a domain name.

Domain names are organised, or grouped, in subordinate divisions of the domain root, which is nameless (refer to *FQDN*). The first level of domains are called /top-level-domains/ or *TLDs* for short. *TLDs* include generic top-level domains such as =com=, =info=, =net=, =edu=, and =org= as well as the country code top-level domains. Below this tier are the second and third-level domains. These are openly available for reservation to internet users. Domain names work from right to left, with the top-level domain appearing on the right. Domain levels are separated with the =.= (full stop) character.

- A /fully qualified domain name/ is all the components of a domain name, which collectively specify the domain's exact location in the domain name system. *FQDNs* are terminated with a full stop, which is characteristic of this type of domain. The point represents the root domain, from which the domain can be located.

- A /subdomain/ is federated by the owner of the parent domain. There is no limit to how many subdomains may be used. Third-level domains are often used to identify a particular host server, eg /mail/ or /www/. Such subdomains may only support the implied functionality.

The /Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers/ (ICANN) is the governing body for the name and number systems used on the internet. There are five /Regional Internet Registries/ globally. Registries are organisations which manage top-level domains. Through a memorandum of understanding, these registries cooperate through the unincorporated /Number Resource Organisation/. Internet resources are distributed to RIRs and disseminated in accordance with the policies of the registry. The commercial sales of domain names are delegated to accredited /internet registrars/. When a customer purchases, or more accurately /leases/, a domain, the registrar notifies the registry which maintains the records. Regional registries allocate blocks of IP addresses to local internet registries, most often internet service providers.

** Protocol Stack

The internet protocol suite is a layered model, in which transmitted data descends through the layers as it is sent. This process is reversed when the data is received. At each layer, the data is further encapsulated in accordance with the workings of the lower-level protocol. The data handled at each layer is sometimes referred to as the /Protocol Datagram Unit/ (PDU). A PDU is composed of protocol-specific control information or header and trailer sections and user data, which may be further encapsulated by protocols operating in layers above. Each layer communicates with the layers immediately adjacent to itself, either the layer above or below during operation.

- *Application Layer:* contains abstract communication protocols used in process-to-process communication over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

- *Transport Layer:* responsible for device-to-device (or end-to-end) communication for applications. This layer facilitates connection-orientated communication (TCP) or best-effort stateless communication (UDP). The PDU for the transport layer is the /segment/ for TCP and the /datagram/ for UDP.

- *Network Layer:* responsible for inter-network communication through network gateways. The PDU of the network layer is the IP packet. The protocols working at this level, most notably IP, are not connection orientated themselves, although can respond to transport layer service requests to provide such a system.

- *Link Layer:* communication protocols limited to the physical connections of the current node within the same network segment. The link layer PDU is called a /frame/.

** IP Addresses

An /Internet Protocol/ address is a unique number assigned to a network interface involved in internet communication. The address identifies and locates the host, which allows a path to the host to be established. IPv4 is a 32-bit standard, although such small addresses have caused IP address shortages. To address this IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length, offering many more addresses. A single IP address must be unique within a particular network, though the same address may be used on two separate networks.

The first portion of an address refers to the network, while the remaining bits are used to identify specific devices. Classful addressing was used to separate the network and host sections of a given address. The table below summarises how many bits were used in class A, B and C addressing. Class D was used for multicast addressing and class E was used for reserved addresses.

|-------+--------------|
| Class | Network Bits |
|-------+--------------|
| A     |            8 |
| B     |           16 |
| C     |           24 |
|-------+--------------|

Classful addressing has been superseded by CIDR notation, where the number of bits in the host portion is appended onto the IP address after a forward slash, for example: =103.27.104.92/24=. This value can be used to determine of the subnet mask, which can be applied to the IP address with a logical AND operation to reveal the network portion. The subnet mask is a 32 bit number containing 1s in what would be the network portion of the address.

Large networks are often divided into smaller subnets for ease of operation and performance. Administration is made easier by reducing the broadcast domain of a single device on a network.

** TCP Handshake

Transmission control protocol is used in conjunction with IP, which is not stateful by itself. TCP is solely responsibly for managing a stateful connection. The journey of each segment is managed by the lower level IP protocol, while TCP remains responsible for the overall dialogue; reconstructing whole communications from individual segments and requesting lost packets are sent again. A TCP segment consists of a segment header and data section.

To open a TCP connection the sender and receiver engage in a three way handshake.

1. *SYN:* sent from the client to the server, the first communication instructs the server to synchronise its sequence number with the number generated on the sender side. Other information including the /Maximum Segment Size/ (MSS) and the /window size/ or buffer capacity of the sender are also sent.

2. *SYN + ACK:* receiver replies with its own sequence number and a synchronisation flag of 1, in addition to an acknowledgement flag. The MSS and window size of the receiver are also sent. Both parties agree upon the smaller MSS to avoid packet fragmentation. From information exchanged at this point, the number of segments that can be exchanged in either direction can be calculated at each end. Finally an acknowledgement number is transmitted, which is the original sequence number incremented by 1.

3. *ACK:* sender replies with the sequence number received as the acknowledgement number from the receiver. The transmitted acknowledgement number is the synchronisation number of the receiver incremented by one and the acknowledgement flag is set to 1.

There are two disconnect methods: the abrupt TCP reset (RST) and the graceful four way disconnect. The RST is sent when either TCP entity is obliged to close the connection or either entity closes both directions of data transfer. The four way disconnect occurs as follows:

1. *FIN:* whichever party initiates the termination sends a TCP segment with the FIN bit sent to 1. The initiator will enter the *FIN_WAIT_1* state, waiting for acknowledgement.

2. *ACK:* acknowledgement in sent immediately from the receiver to the initiator. When the initiator receives acknowledgement from the receiver, it enters *FIN_WAIT_2* state, until a TCP segment containing a *FIN* bit is received.

3. *FIN:* after some closing operations are completed by the receiver, another TCP segment is sent, with the *FIN* bit set.

4. *ACK:* the initiator enters the *TIME_WAIT* state and final acknowledgement is sent. The acknowledgement may be resent during the period the initiator remains in the waiting state. After a certain implementation dependent time, the connection is formally closed.

** Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption is a vitally important component of internet communication. Using /public key cryptography/ it is possible to establish fully encrypted bidirectional communication without sharing a common key in advance. A cryptographic algorithm is required to generate mathematically linked public/private key pairs. Of the two, the public key can be widely disseminated, so long as the private key remains secret. Any party is able to encrypt a piece of information with the public key, which can only be decrypted with the private key.

** Digital Signatures & Certificates

A /digital signature/ is a methods of determining authenticity. If a client verifies a signature it is safe to conclude that the message was authored by a known sender. Signatures also offer /non-repudiation/, which means it can not be claimed that both a signature was not produced by a known party and the private key remains private. Digital signatures function as outlined below:

1. A key pair is generated by an appropriate key generation algorithm.
2. Signature is produced from the private key and the plain text.
3. Plain text, public key and signature are used in conjunction for verification.

To produce the signature, the original message may be encrypted in its entirety or a hash may be used in its place. Whichever is the case, the same procedure must be used on during verification.

A signature is an effective method of guaranteeing the authenticity of a particular message. To identify a particular host or server a /digital certificate/ is used as well. These are issued by a trusted /certificate authority/ (CA). A certificate will contain information such as the serial number, expiry date, holder credentials, holder public key and the digital signature of the CA itself. A CA certificate enables a host to operate secure, encrypted /TLS/ connections.

** TLS

/Transport Layer Security/ (TLS) is an encryption protocol designed to secure internet communication. TLS and the deprecated SSL protocol which it replaces, do not fit neatly into any one layer of the TCP/IP stack. TLS depends on a stateful connection, so it exists somewhere above the transport layer. Like TCP, operating a TLS connections requires a handshake to establish a secure connection. The steps are outlined below:

1. Client initiates handshake, communicating information including the supported TLS versions and available cipher suites.

2. Server notifies client of selected cipher suite and provides digital certificate.

3. Client verifies the received certificate. The client generates a /pre-master secret/ and encrypts it with the server's public key to be transmitted.

4. Using its private key, the server decrypts the incoming secret, which is now shared by both computers. This is used to generate a session key.

5. Fully symmetric bidirectional encrypted communication is achieved.

** Local Networks

The rapid consumption of available addresses that afflicts the 32-bit IPv4 system has been slowed by the uptake of private, non-routable addresses in local networks. These addresses must remain unique within the local network, although there is no expectation that these addresses are globally unique, they may be reused on another network. As a result, acquiring a private IP address does not involve an internet registry. Communication between two devices on different networks requires another system, called /Network Address Translation/ (NAT).

- /Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol/ automatically provides IP information to devices on a network. This includes the allocation of an IP address and networking information such as the subnet mask. IP addresses may be allocated /dynamically/, whereby one device may receive any address from the pool of available addresses and be subject to a changing address, or by /static/ reservation, where a single device permanently uses the same private IP address.

- If a device inside one network with a private IP address needs to communicate with a device on the public internet, its private IP address is replaced with the public IP address of the network gateway. Any response to the outgoing communication will reach the network router, which recorded ongoing communications in a translation table. Using this information, the publicly routable address is replaced with the private IP address of the correct device.

- To allow devices outside a particular network access to a server operating within, /port forwarding/ rules are configured on the network router. The firewall maps incoming requests on specified ports to devices within the network.

** Internet Security

Routing devices, joining two networks may incorporate a security system called a /firewall/. Different firewall implementations may be hardware or software devices. A dedicated firewall device may contain two NICs connected to a single computer, one facing the internal network that the firewall is designed to protect and the other facing the external untrustworthy network.

- /Firewalls/ may use /static filtering/ pre-configured rules, inspecting the source and destination IP address and port number of incoming or outgoing communications to determine if the traffic can pass.

- /Stateful Inspection/ may be used to examine the payload contents of IP packets. This information is sometimes used to create temporary contextual rules for ongoing communication.

- /Proxy servers/ are intermediary devices, offering protection to client devices, by concealing their identity. Source IP addresses are replaced with that of the proxy-server. When a response is received, the communications is forwarded to the original client. Proxy servers can operate a local cache, for frequently requested data.
