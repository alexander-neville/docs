These are my notes on AQA a-level computer science. Note that the section headers do not reflect specification points. I wrote these notes in plain text and all of the typesetting was performed automatically, so I cannot be sure the pdf copy resembles the source file exactly as intended. I may have made some mistakes, so cross-referencing may not be a bad idea if you are unsure.

For variable names I prefer to use all lowercase with an =_= (underscore) as space, or follow an agreed upon standard. In some places I have used capitals for the first letter of each word, in keeping with the textbook, although it shouldn't matter. I have italicised some key terms, although there are some inconsistencies.
